## Compatible libraries

Relatively few libraries support cats-effect directly at this time. However, most (if not all) popular testing frameworks have libraries offering some level of integration

- [cats-effect-testing](https://github.com/djspiewak/cats-effect-testing): Supports Scalatest, Specs2, munit, minitest, ÂµTest, and scalacheck
- [@Daenyth's IOSpec gist](https://gist.github.com/Daenyth/67575575b5c1acc1d6ea100aae05b3a9) for scalatest (library pending)
- [munit-cats-effect](https://github.com/typelevel/munit-cats-effect)
- [weaver-test](https://disneystreaming.github.io/weaver-test/): Supported natively

## Property-based Testing

### Scalacheck

Scalacheck primarily supports properties in the shape `A => Assertion`.
To support writing effectful properties with the shape `A => F[Assertion]`, you can use one of these tools:

- [scalacheck-effect](https://github.com/typelevel/scalacheck-effect)
- [cats-effect-testing](https://github.com/djspiewak/cats-effect-testing)

You might also want to use [cats-scalacheck](https://christopherdavenport.github.io/cats-scalacheck/), which provides instances of `cats-core` typeclasses.

## Best practices

Avoid using `unsafe*` methods in tests, the same as you'd avoid them in "main" code.
Writing tests to be structured the same way as "normal" code results in tests that are less likely to be flaky, act as executable documentation, and remain easy to read.

Use a compatible framework's support for writing `IO[Assertion]` style tests.

### Testing concurrency

When possible, use `TestContext` as your `ExecutionContext`, `ContextShift`, and `Timer`. This is generally the case if your code uses `Timer` and `Clock` to perform time-related operations, and doesn't directly read or interact with the jvm System clock.

To simulate time passing in the test, use `Timer[F].sleep(duration)`, which will defer to `TestContext`.

Some reference material on this approach:

- [TestContext api documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.typelevel/cats-effect-laws_2.13/2.2.0/cats/effect/laws/util/TestContext.html) (includes examples and motivation)
- [Time Traveling in Tests with Cats-Effect](https://blog.softwaremill.com/time-traveling-in-tests-with-cats-effect-b22084f6a89), by Krzysztof Ciesielski

### Managing shared resources

Sometimes you'll want to write a test that acquires a Resource before the suite and releases it after. For example, spinning up a database.

For test frameworks that use imperative "hook"-style methods (such as scalatest's `BeforeAndAfterAll` mixin), you can use [`allocated`](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/api/cats/effect/Resource.html#allocated[G[x]%3E:F[x],B%3E:A](implicitF:cats.effect.Bracket[G,Throwable]):G[(B,G[Unit])])

```scala mdoc:invisible
import cats.effect._
```

```scala mdoc:compile-only
class Database {
    def close(): Unit = ???
}

object Database {
  def resource: Resource[IO, Database] = Resource.make(IO(new Database))(d => IO(d.close()))
}

class TestSuite {
  private var _database: Option[(Database, IO[Unit])] = None
  private def database: Database = _database.getOrElse(sys.error("not currently alive!"))._1

  def beforeAll: Unit = {
    _database = Some(Database.resource.allocated.unsafeRunSync())
    ()
  }

  def afterAll: Unit = {
    _database.foreach(_._2.unsafeRunSync())
    _database = None
  }

  /* tests using `database` */
  def test = {
      assert(database != null)
  }
}
```
