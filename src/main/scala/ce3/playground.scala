  /**
   * Implements a cooperative parallel interpreter for Free with a global state space,
   * given an injection for state and a traversable pattern functor. The state is
   * shared across all simultaneous suspensions and will survive short-circuiting
   * in the target monad (if relevant). Note that callers are responsible for
   * ensuring that any short circuiting in the target monad is handled prior to
   * suspending the actual fork, otherwise the short circuiting will propagate
   * through the entire system and terminate all suspensions.
   *
   * Forks are defined by a non-empty traversal on the suspension pattern functor
   * (excepting the state pattern). In most interpreter-like usage of Free, suspensions
   * are only trivially traversable, in that they contain no case which contains any
   * sub-structure. As an example, the StateF pattern functor has two cases, GetF and
   * PutF, neither of which contain an "A". Thus, while StateF does form a Traverse,
   * it is always empty and trivial. These patterns are considered to be "non-forking".
   *
   * Pattern instances which *do* contain one or more "A" values representing forks.
   * We evaluate these by taking each A "hole" and passing it to the continuation
   * *independently*. Which is to say, whenever you suspend a forking pattern instance,
   * any flatMap which succeeds it will be instantiated with *n + 1* different values:
   *
   * - Once for the value which is returned from the T ~> M interpreter
   * - Once for each value of type A within the fork
   *
   * The best way to think of this is that it is similar to the `fork()` function
   * in the C standard library, which returns different results whether you're in
   * the child or the parent. Suspending a forking pattern and then binding on it
   * will see different values depending on whether you're in the main fiber
   * (which will receive the value from the T ~> M interpreter) or in one of the
   * forked continuations (which will receive a corresponding value from the
   * suspension).
   *
   * "Daemon" semantics correspond to a mode in which forked suspensions with
   * outstanding continuations are ignored if the main suspension reaches
   * completion (either Pure or Suspend). This is analogous to how daemon threads
   * will not prevent the termination of the JVM, even if they still have outstanding
   * work when the main thread terminates. Non-daemon semantics will cause the
   * final result to be held pending the resolution of all forked suspensions.
   *
   * Sequence orders are deterministic, but not guaranteed to follow any particular
   * order. In other words, race conditions can and will happen, but if they resolve
   * in a particular direction in one run, they will resolve in the same direction
   * on the next run unless other changes are made. Changes to the structure of the
   * forked Free(s) (such as adding or removing an extra flatMap) can and will have
   * an impact on evaluation order, and thus race condition resolution.
   *
   * Fairness is not considered. If you care about fairness, you probably also care
   * about other little things like... uh... performance.
